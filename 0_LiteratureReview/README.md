### ðŸ”¹ Source 1: [Accurate and reproducible invasive breast cancer detection in whole-slide images: A Deep Learning approach for quantifying tumor extent](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46450#Tab4)

- **Objective**: Develop a deep learning method to detect invasive tumor regions in pathology slides.
- **Methods**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 400 annotated WSIs and validated on 200 additional cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
- **Outcomes**: Achieved a Dice coefficient of **75.86%**, with a **positive predictive value of 71.62%** and **negative predictive value of 96.77%**.
- **Relation to the Project**: Demonstrates CNNsâ€™ effectiveness in cancer region identification on WSIsâ€”applicable for classifying colon polyps as benign or malignant.

### ðŸ”¹ Source 2: [Deep learning in cancer genomics and histopathology](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-024-01315-6)

- **Objective**: Review deep learning applications in histopathology and genomics for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
- **Methods**: Explores CNNs, Vision Transformers (ViTs), weak/strong supervision, and MIL techniques.
- **Outcomes**: DL models can achieve high performance across tasks (classification, mutation prediction, survival modeling) but require attention to bias and generalization issues.
- **Relation to the Project**: Informs the selection of appropriate architectures (e.g., MIL, ViTs) and supervision strategies for colon polyp classification.

### ðŸ”¹ Source 3: [A Petri Dish for Histopathology Image Analysis (MHIST Dataset)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12355)

- **Objective**: Present a curated dataset for colorectal polyp classification using DL.
- **Methods**: Compiled 3,152 image tiles (224Ã—224 px) from 328 WSIs of hyperplastic polyps (HPs) and sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), anonymized and verified for quality.
- **Outcomes**: MHIST serves as a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating deep learning models in histopathology.
- **Relation to the Project**: Provides a directly relevant dataset for developing and testing computer vision models to distinguish benign from malignant colon polyps.
